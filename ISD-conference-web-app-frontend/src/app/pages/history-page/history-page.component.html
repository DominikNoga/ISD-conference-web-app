        The <strong>International Conference on Information Systems Development </strong>is an academic conference
        hosted
        annually across different locations worldwide, where scientists and practitioners are welcome to participate and
        share their knowledge and expertise in the field of information systems development. During its history, the
        conference has focused on different aspects – ranging from methodological,
        infrastructural, or educational challenges in the ISD field, to bridging the gaps between industry, academia,
        and
        society. However,
        the mission of the conference has remained the same throughout its time: to research,
        share, and discuss developments and trends in Information Systems and Information Systems Development.

        Demanding high-quality standards, the organizers and reviewers put the quality of submitted papers over
        quantity,
        which has kept the conference size at an intimate level with an average of 100 papers, and where each researcher
        receives a significant audience.
