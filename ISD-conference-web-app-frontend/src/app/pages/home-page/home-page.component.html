                        conference provides a forum
                        for
                        research and developments in the field of information systems. The theme of ISD {{ YEAR }} is

                        The post-COVID-19 era has posed significant challenges, not only for software development teams,
                        prompting
                        them
                        to
                        revisit their practices, procedures, and collaboration models, but also for entire
                        organizations, which must
                        undergo
                        cultural, structural, and process transformations to leverage the opportunities presented by
                        hybrid work.

                        Alongside this shift, recent advancements in the AI ecosystem have given rise to powerful large

                        models
                        (LLMs), fundamentally reshaping the software profession by reducing the technical expertise
                        required for
                        excellence.
                        Furthermore, generative AI tools have streamlined software development processes by providing
                        valuable
                        assistance
                        across all phases of the software development life cycle.

                        ISD has evolved since the first Polish-Scandinavian Seminar on Current Trends in Information
                        Systems Development
                        Methodologies, held in Gdańsk, Poland in 1988. Since 1997 it has been held as an annual
                        international conference
                        and is now a highly regarded IS conference.
